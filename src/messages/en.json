I chose to step back and ask: 'If existing paths don't work, can I build my own?' In that near-blank silence, I buried myself in programming and model structures—not for school, but to reclaim choice over my own life."

The denoising mechanisms and architectures fascinated me more than the tools themselves. I realized that what's scarce isn't users, but the courage to understand fundamentals. This marked my shift from self-taught to storyteller."
